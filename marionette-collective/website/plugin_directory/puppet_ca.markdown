### Revoke:

Note how puppetca doesn't behave too well when you ask it to revoke a certificate that doesn't exist, doesn't cause problems though

<pre>
% mco rpc puppetca revoke certname=host3.your.net
Determining the amount of hosts matching filter for 2 seconds .... 2

 * [ ============================================================> ] 2 / 2


puppet1.your.net
   Result: notice: Revoked certificate with serial 156

puppet2.your.net
   Result: notice: Revoked certificate with serial # Inventory of signed certificates
</pre>

### Clean

<pre>
% mco rpc puppetca clean certname=host3.your.net
Determining the amount of hosts matching filter for 2 seconds .... 2

 * [ ============================================================> ] 2 / 2


monitor3.your.net
   Result: Removed signed cert: /var/lib/puppet/ssl/ca/signed/host3.your.net.pem.
